# Title: NLP Document Classification

## Overview:
This repository contains the code and data for a document classification project. The goal is to build a classifier that can predict the category of a document based on its content. The dataset includes information such as document class, title, date, and body.

## Key Features:
- **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify any missing values.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data by handling missing values and applying text preprocessing techniques.
- **Feature Selection:** Identify and select relevant features for document representation.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement and evaluate machine learning models, including Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest, for document classification.
- **Performance Comparison:** Compare the performance of models using different feature sets, such as body text and title.

## Project Structure:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset in tab-separated format.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model implementation.
- `report/`:project report.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/anasakram12/NLP_Classification.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd NLP_Classification`
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks and scripts in the `notebooks/` directory.
4. Run the notebooks to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn for data analysis and machine learning tasks.
